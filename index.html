        <h4>Our Story</h4>
        <img id="worker" src="assets/img2.jpeg">
        <p>Trail takes its name from what we believe are the two key componants of any
 skateboard shape, the tail and the rail. We believe that there should be no "one size fits all"
  rule for both shape and size when it comes to boards. <br>
  We have poured countless hours of research into the relationship beween every dimention of a board
   and how each one plays a vital role in a skaters ability to perform how they want to.<br>
   We work with skaters, both pro and am, to create their perfect board, custom making samples for them to try, before 
   finalizing a design which we store on our system for future use and manufacture.

        <h4>What we believe in</h4>
        <img id="dimentions" src="assets/img1.jpeg">
        <ul>
            <li>No two skaters are alike, so why should their boards be</li>
            <li>Having a board that is perfect for your style and ability shouldn't be reserved just for pros</li>
            <li>We only use wood from sustainable sources, and all our packaging recyclable or compostable</li>
        </ul>
